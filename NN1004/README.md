## Descriptions

The PAM8403 amplifier board is a dual-channel (stereo) amplifier that produces 6W (3W+3W) output. As any major amplifier system needs to have short circuit protection, PAM8403 has inbuilt short circuit protection that is essential for trouble-free operations. PAM8403 Amplifier IC itself does not require any kind of heat sink, so this will be a perfect choice for custom speaker projects. It can directly drive 4Ω or 8Ω speakers. It is mandatory to use a proper speaker with not more than a 3W output rating.

## Descriptions

The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I<sup>2</sup>C real-time clock (RTC) with an integrated temperaturecompensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal.
The device incorporates a battery input, and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power to the device is interrupted. The integration of the crystal resonator enhances the long-term accuracy of the device as well as reduces the piece-part count in a manufacturing line.

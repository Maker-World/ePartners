## Descriptions

This ZB2L3 is a Li-ion Battery capacity tester board, which can measure the capacity of the fully charged battery connected at its inputs it also has 1W resistors that can be used to discharge the battery at the constant current output.

After the capacity test has been completed the capacity of the battery is displayed on the 4 digits 7 segment display, which can also display the current supplied by the batter as well as the battery voltage.

## Descriptions

Sliding Adjustable Potentiometer Module 10k is an electronic slider potentiometer module which is adjustable or compatible with Arduino for all your DIY needs. This is a sliding type potentiometer whose resistance can adjustable with the help of the slider switch.

This is actually two 5 kOhm potentiometers in one. Each operates independently of the other. In most applications it will only require three connections to your Arduino. As a slide potentiometer, it can offer some intuitive benefits in to an operator interface. For example, controlling up and down, forward and reverse, left and right, can be confusing when incorporating a rotary potentiometer.

This particular slider has what is known as a logarithmic taper from the center position. That is to say, the further you move from center (in either direction), the less the change in resistance per mm of travel. Both grounds and power inputs are the same electrical point. The outputs however, are separated.

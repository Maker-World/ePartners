## Descriptions

Infrared IR Sensor Obstacle Avoidance Sensor board is an inexpensive solution to avoidance detection for robotics, smart car, and other electronic uses.

Infrared Obstacle Sensor Module has a built-in IR transmitter and IR receiver that sends out IR energy and looks for reflected IR energy to detect the presence of any obstacle in front of the sensor module. The module has an onboard potentiometer that lets users adjust the detection range. The sensor has a very good and stable response even in ambient light or in complete darkness.

The Obstacle Avoidance Sensors usually come in two types â€” with 3 and 4 pins.

| 2 LED Indicators          | Green (Object Detection Indicators) and Red (Power Indicators)                                              |
| Obstacle detection range  | 2cm-20cm                                                                                                    |
| Detection angle           | 35 degree                                                                                                   |
| Single bit output         |                                                                                                             |
| 3 pins                    | VCC, GND, OUT                                                                                               |
| Distance Adjust pots      | Adjust detection distance (CCW decreases distance/CW increases distance).                                   |
|                           | should not be changed. It controls the frequency of the infrared signal, and is preset with a good setting. |
| IR Emitter                | Infrared emitter LED                                                                                        |
| IR Receiver               | Infrared receiver that receives signal transmitted by Infrared emitter.                                     |

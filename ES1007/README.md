## Description

The ESP-12S is a self contained 802.11 b/g/n WiFi enabled microcontroller featuring the ESP8266 SOC. Pin for pin compatible with other boards in the ESP-12 range but with improved stability and wireless capability. This board has up to 13 usable GPIO pins (inc 5 dual purpose) and an ADC input. It has 4Mbyte flash memory and software updates can be rolled out to it over-the-air. Use it as a cheap and easy way to add WiFi to your Arduino / Raspberry Pi etc, or use it as a powerful standalone WiFi enabled MCU in its own right.

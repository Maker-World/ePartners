## Descriptions

The capacitive touch sensor (TTP223B) is a touchpad detector which offers 1 touch key. The touching detection is designed for replacing traditional direct button key. The touch sensor can be used for various projects.

The sensor is essentially a button style sensor that detects when it is being pressed. One of the main differences is that it detects the presence of your finger on the sensor. This means that it doesnâ€™t require any force to activate the button.

Depending on your setup using a capacitive touch sensor may aid your design as there is no actuation force needed. This can be useful in situations where pressing a button may stress the circuit board.

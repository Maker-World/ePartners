## Descriptions

Widely used in motor speed detection, pulse count, the position limit, etc. The DO
output interface can be directly connected to a micro-controller IO port, if there is a block
detection sensor, such as the speed of the motor encoder can detect.
DO modules can be connected to the relay, limit switch, and other functions, it can
also with the active buzzer module, compose alarm.

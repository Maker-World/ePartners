## Descriptions

Arduino Data Logger Shield has been designed to save data to files in a FAT16- or FAT32-formatted SD card in a very easy way that can be read later by most plotting, spreadsheet, or analysis programs. This shield also has onboard Real Time Clock (RTC) so you can save all data with current time.

## Description

This WiFi relay based on AI-Thinker ESP-01/ 01S WiFi module, we use the GPIO0 of ESP-01/ 01S to control the relay by low level. Itâ€™s easy to DIY your smart switch to any device by your phone anywhere with this smart relay.

## Tips

-   Mobile phone equipped with WiFi module;
-   Mobile phone and WiFI module equipped with the same router, through the mobile phone APP to control the relay; this mode, the transmission distance depends on the signal router.
-   ESP8266 module has a timeout mechanism, when the phone for some time (the default 180S) did not give instructions to the module, the module will kick off the phone, the computer can send AT + CIPSTO = time to modify this time (Time range 0-7200), such as: AT + CIPSTO = 3600.
-   When the module on the WIFI module is unplugged, USB to TTL module RX, TX, GND pins were connected to the module RX, TX, GND pin, IN +, IN- 5V power supply, then the module can be used as a USB Relays to use, scalability.

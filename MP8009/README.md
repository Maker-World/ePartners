## Descriptions

The AOD4184A combines advanced trench MOSFET technology with a low resistance package to provide extremely low RDS(ON). This device is well suited for high current load applications.
This MOSFET module uses two parallel N-Channel logic compatible MOSFETS with low Rds(on) for high current low-side switching applications.

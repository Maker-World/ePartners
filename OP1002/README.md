## Descriptions

The WeMos D1 min PRO is a miniature wireless 802.11 (Wifi) microcontroller development board. It turns the very popular ESP8266 wireless microcontroller module into a fully fledged development board. Programming the D1 mini pro is as simple as programming any other Arduino based microcontroller as the module includes a built in microUSB interface allowing the module to be programmed directly from the Arduino IDE (requires the ESP8266 support to be added via board manager) with no additional hardware.

The D1 mini Pro is also designed to allow Wemos compatible shields to be plugged into the board in a similar way to the Arduino development board platform which greatly expands its capabilities. There is already a large range of compatible shields available and can also be purchased via our website. Included with the module is a set of headers (requires soldering) that allow thses shield to be easily added or removed from the D1 mini PRO.

Other features of the D1 Mini Pro include 11 digital input/output pins, 1 analogue input pin (3.2V Max), 16MB (128M bit) Flash, an external antenna connector, built in ceramic antenna and houses the new CP2104 US to UART IC. The D1 Pro is the same size as the D1 mini, but is lighter.

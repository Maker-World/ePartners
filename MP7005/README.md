| Pin Number | Pin Name | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1          | Vcc      | The Vcc pin powers the sensor, typically with +5V                  |
| 2          | Trigger  | Trigger pin is an Input pin. This pin has to be kept high for 10us |
|            |          | to initialize measurement by sending US wave.                      |
| 3          | Echo     | Echo pin is an Output pin.                                         |
|            |          | This pin goes high for a period of time                            |
|            |          | which will be equal to the time taken for the US wave              |
|            |          | to return back to the sensor.                                      |
| 4          | Ground   | This pin is connected to the Ground of the system.                 |

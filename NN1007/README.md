## Descriptions

A function generator is an indispensable of electronics lab equipment, but unfortunately such a costly device is not within the easy reach of an average electronics hobbyist. We know that there are a lot of do-it-yourself designs out there, but the most popular (and inexpensive) Chinese kit in the market is the one based on the nifty function generator chip XR2206. Based on my experience, the easy to build 1Hz-IMHz XR2206 function generator kit allows a variety of routine measurements and experiments, and offers fairer quality sine, square, and triangle output waveforms with moderate stability and accuracy.

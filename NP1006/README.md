## Descriptions

Fire Alarm Systems are very common in commercial building and factories, these devices usual contain a cluster of sensors that constantly monitors for any flame, gas or fire in the building and triggers an alarm if it detects any of these. One of the simplest way to detect fire is by using an IR Flame sensor, these sensors have an IR photodiode which is sensitive to IR light. Now, in the event of a fire, the fire will not only produce heat but will also emit IR rays, yes every burning flame will emit some level of IR light, this light is not visible to human eyes but our flame sensor can detect it and alert a microcontroller like Arduino that a fire has been detected.

A flame detector is a sensor designed to detect and respond to the presence of a flame or fire. Responses to a detected flame depend on the installation but can include sounding an alarm, deactivating a fuel line (such as a propane or a natural gas line), and activating a fire suppression system. The IR Flame sensor used in this project is shown below, these sensors are also called Fire sensor module or flame detector sensor sometimes.

## Descriptions

Thermistor Sensor Module is used to sense temperature and convert it into output signals. It is associated with both analog output pin and digital output pin labelled as AO and DO respectively on the board. Thermistor Sensor Module is made of semiconductor materials. Basically thermistor sensors are mostly Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC), which means NTC thermistors will have their electrical resistance decreased when subjected to an increase in body temperature. This module has a potentiometer knob that can be adjusted to change the sensitivity of thermistor towards temperature.

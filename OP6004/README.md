## Descriptions

The RGB TCS3472 Color Sensor Module is one of the best modules with which you can see different and stunning colors. This module is the best color sensor on the market that has RGB and Clear light sensing elements.

This module has an IR filter that filters the IR spectrum, resulting in a larger color spectrum that can be viewed with high accuracy. The range of this module is 3800000:1. Therefore it is suitable for use behind dark glass.

## Descriptions

This is a square wave pulse generator module based on the ubiquitous NE555 timer IC. The module can be powered from a wide power supply range (4.5 to 12V) and will produce a continuous square wave output between 15Hz to 24KHz which can be set by on on-board multi-turn potentiometer. Useful for applications where an approximate frequency clock source is required such as for stepper motor step generation tone generation etc.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chip: NE555.                                                                                |
| Supply voltage: 4.5 to 12V                                                                  |
| Supply current: 3mA at 5V Vcc                                                               |
| Min freq (approx): 15Hz 49% duty cycle at 5V Vcc                                            |
| Max freq (approx): 24KHz 89.4% duty cycle at 5V Vcc                                         |
| Output voltage: 4.5V at 5Vcc / 11.5V at 12Vcc                                               |
| A single channel output, the output duty cycle square wave is about fifty percent.          |
| Onboard adjustable resistance, resistance can be controlled to adjust the output frequency. |
| Size: 29 (mm) x12 (mm)                                                                      |

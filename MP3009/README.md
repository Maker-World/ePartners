## Descriptions

This Analog Piezoelectric Ceramic Vibration Module buffers a piezoelectric transducer that responds to strain changes by generating a measurable output voltage change which is proportional with the strength of vibration also known as 'piezoelectric effect'. So you can know the extent of vibration. Different from digital vibration sensor that only accounts times, this analog one can tell extent of vibration.

When the piezoelectric ceramic shocking will generate an electrical signal, controller analog port can be perceived slight vibration signals, also can be realized with vibration interactions related works, such as electronic drums. The output voltage is proportional to the strength of shock or vibration. So you can measure and characterize the vibration.

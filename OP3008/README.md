## Descriptions

The camera module OV7670 can be interfaced with Arduino Mega with same pin configuration, code and steps. The camera module is hard to interface because it has large number of pins and jumbled wiring to carry out. Also the wire becomes very important when using camera modules as the choice of the wire and length of the wire can significantly affect the picture quality and can bring noise.

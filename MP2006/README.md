## Descriptions

Infrared IR Sensor Obstacle Avoidance Sensor board is an inexpensive solution to avoidance detection for robotics, smart car, and other electronic uses.

Infrared Obstacle Sensor Module has a built-in IR transmitter and IR receiver that sends out IR energy and looks for reflected IR energy to detect the presence of any obstacle in front of the sensor module. The module has an onboard potentiometer that lets users adjust the detection range. The sensor has a very good and stable response even in ambient light or in complete darkness.

The Obstacle Avoidance Sensors usually come in two types â€” with 3 and 4 pins.

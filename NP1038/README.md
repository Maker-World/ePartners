## Descriptions

The seven segments displays are the oldest yet one of the efficient types of display used in embedded applications. This display has nothing more than 8 LED inside it. These 8 LEDs are separated into each segments which can be named as a,b,c,d,e,f,g,DP. These entire 8 segment LEDs have one end of their pins pulled out of the module as shown above and the other ends are connected together and pulled out as the Common pin. So to make an LED of a particular segment glow we just have to power common pin along with the segment pin. This way we can power more than one segment at a time to represent the numeric number 0-9 and also few Alphabets.

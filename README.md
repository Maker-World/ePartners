## Description

The ESP32-S is a wireless module based on ESP32, supports WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2, with built-in 32Mbit Flash, in the SMD38 package. There're also onboard PCB antenna and metal shield. In short, it's a small form factor and fairly high cost effective wireless module.

With the pre-flashed AT firmware, you can control the module through UART AT commands easily. The module integrates MCU inside, supports other developments like Lua/Micropython/Arduino to achieve flexible and fast prototyping, make it easy to integrate the module into IoT applications.

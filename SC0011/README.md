## Descriptions

The DS3231 High-Precision Real Time Clock Module is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C real-time clock (RTC).
It has an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal.
The device incorporates a battery input and maintains accurate timekeeping when the main power to the device is interrupted.
Integrated crystal resonator improves the long-term accuracy of the device and reduces the number of components in the production line.

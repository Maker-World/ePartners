## Descriptions

KY-033 tracking sensor module is ideal for the design of a wheeled robot with obstacle avoidance adjustable distance feature. This sensor is light adaptable, high precision, with a pair of infrared transmitter and receiver. Transmitter tube emits a certain frequency of infrared ray, and when detecting the direction of an obstacle (reflector), the infrared receiver tube receiver is reflected back; when the indicator lights on,through the circuit, the signal output interface outputs the digital signal that can be detected by the potentiometer knob to adjust the distance, and the effective distance is from 2 ~ 40cm, working voltage ranges from 3.3V-5V, which works for a variety of micro-controllers, Arduino controller, BS2 controller,and when attached to the robot it can sense changes around their surroundings.

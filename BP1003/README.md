## Descriptions

Motor drive module is ideal for use in battery-powered smart car, toy cars, robots.
Supply voltage 2V ~ 10V, can drive two DC motors or a 4-wire 2-phase stepper motors, can achieve forward rotation or reverse rotation, it is possible to adjust the rotation speed.
Each can provide continuous current of 1.5A, peak current up to 2.5A, thermal protection and can be automatically restored.

## Description

-   ESP-12F is an enhanced version of ESP8266-12E, improve the peripheral circuit, the four laminates plate process, enhanced impedance matching, the signal output is better, it is stable with anti-jamming ability,
-   PCB antenna after professional laboratory testing, perfect matching, after ROHS certification, have been greatly improved!
-   The enhanced version is fully compatible with the firmware before the ESP-12, based on the SPI and the new six IO port, mouth extraction.
-   ESP-12F: ground-breaking design, the new four-layer board design, the new revision antenna RF performance optimization, increased by 30% -50% Communication distance compared to the ESP-12E! Semi-hole chip technology, the whole IO leads, with metal shielding shell, has passed FCC & CE & RoHS certification, built-board PCB antenna, 4M bytes Flash.

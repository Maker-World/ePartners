## Descriptions

This module is sensitive to the light, Usually used for detecting the ambient brightness and light intensity.
When there is no light or the light intensity can not reach the value,DO output is high level.when light intensity over than the value, the module DO output is low level.
The module digital output DO can be directly connected with the microcontroller,use microcontroller detect high or low level, so that can detect the environmental light intensity change.
Can use this board digital output DO port drive relay module directly(our store on sale these relay modules), can also use as a photoelectric switch. The analog output AO connects with AD module, and it can get more precise light intensity value through the AD converter.

## Pins

| Pin Name | Description           |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| VCC      | power supply          |
| GND      | Ground                |
| D0       | Digital output signal |

**Note:**
**- Strong light, LED light, output 'low' level**
**- Weak light, LED off, output high level**
**- Sensitivity is adjustable.**

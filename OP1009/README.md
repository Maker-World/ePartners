## Descriptions

Powering the D1 Mini can easily be done with the DC Power Shield. This unit can handle up to 24 Volts which will easily handle even larger motors you have in mind to control. The barrel jack connection makes it perfect for a 9 Volt battery connection as well which will also be plenty to power multiple components as well as the D1 mini.

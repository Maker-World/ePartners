## Descriptions

IR or infrared communication is one of the most common methods of wireless communication due to being easy to use and having an affordable price. Infrared light, with a wavelength longer than visible light, is not within the range of human vision. That’s why it’s a good option for wireless communications. When you press a button on your TV control, an LED on your control turns on and off continuously and causes a modulated infrared signal to send from the control to your TV. The command will execute after the signal is demodulated. IR receiver modules are used to receive IR signals. These modules work in 3, 8 KHz frequency. When the sensor is not exposed to any light at its working frequency, the Vout output has a value equal to VS (power supply). With exposing to a 38 kHz infrared light, this output will be zero.

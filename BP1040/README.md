## Descriptions

The L9110S Dual Channel Motor Driver Module is a compact board that can be used to drive very small robots. This tiny module has two independent L9110Smotor driver chips which can each drive up 800mA of continuous current. The boards can be operated from 2.5V to 12V enabling this module to be used with both 3.3V and 5V microcontrollers. A set of male header pins is used to connect this module to your robot's microcontroller brain. The motors are attached via two sets of screw terminals. A PWM Pulse Width Modulation signal is used to control the speed of a motor and a digital output is used to change its direction. This module can also be used to drive a single four-line two-phase stepper motor. Four holes make this board easy to mount onto your robot or other project.

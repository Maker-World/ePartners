## Descriptions

A rotary encoder is a type of position sensor which is used for determining the angular position of a rotating shaft. It generates an electrical signal, either analog or digital, according to the rotational movement.
There are many different types of rotary encoders which are classified by either Output Signal or Sensing Technology. The particular rotary encoder that we will use in this tutorial is an incremental rotary encoder and it’s the simplest position sensor to measure rotation.
This rotary encoder is also known as quadrature encoder or relative rotary encoder and its output is a series of square wave pulses.

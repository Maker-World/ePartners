## Descriptions

TILT SENSOR MODULE is a device used for knowing the planar movement. Although they are available in various types their basic function remains the same.

Recent technological advancements in the manufacturing of tilt sensors have improved accuracy,
reduced cost, and increased lifetime. The type SW-520D is a commonly available roller-ball type tilt
sensor consists of two conductive elements (poles) and a conductive free mass (rolling ball),
encapsulated in the same case. When the tilt sensor is oriented so that that end is downwards, the
mass rolls onto the poles and shorts them, acting as a switch stroke. Microcontroller-compatible tilt
sensor modules based on SW-520D are also available at affordable costs.
Electronics circuitry behind this tiny module is usually centered around the dual- comparator chip
LM393. The module features a tilt sensor, a signal amplifier, a standard 3-pin header, a power indicator
that signals that the module is correctly powered, and a status indicator that lights up when a tilt is
detected by the tilt sensor.

## Description

This is a breadboard adapter for the popular ESP-01 model of the ESP8266 serial-to-WiFi transceiver module.
As ESP-01 Pin arrangements are not breadboard friendly and are not labeled, which makes it little inconvenient for rapid prototyping.This breadboard adapter will help you to make prototyping with esp-01 module much more easier.
This breakout conveniently offers clear pinout silkprint on top and will nicely fit your prefered breadboard.
Last but not least, we added a 0.1ÂµF decoupling capacitor so the ESP-01 will always run smoothly and without a hitch

## Descriptions

Tiny and lightweight with high output power. Servo can rotate approximately 180 degrees
(90 in each direction), and works just like the standard kinds but smaller. You can use any
servo code, hardware or library to control these servos. Good for beginners who want to make
stuff move without building a motor controller with feedback & gear box, especially since it
will fit in small places. It comes with a 3 horns (arms) and hardware.

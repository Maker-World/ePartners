## Descriptions

This shield is mounted with DS18B20 digital thermometer that provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with non-volatile user-programmable upper and lower trigger points. This sensor can be interfaced using 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one data line and ground for communication. The pin used for this sensor is D2 pin of WeMos D1 Mini and Mini PRO, which rendered this shield to be not I2C compatible.

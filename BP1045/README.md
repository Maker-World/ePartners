## Descriptions

A rotary encoder is a type of position sensor which is used for determining the angular position of a rotating shaft. It generates an electrical signal, either analog or digital, according to the rotational movement.
There are many different types of rotary encoders which are classified by either Output Signal or Sensing Technology. The particular rotary encoder that we will use in this tutorial is an incremental rotary encoder and itâ€™s the simplest position sensor to measure rotation.
This rotary encoder has 12 steps but others may have more or less.

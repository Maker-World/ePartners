## Descriptions

Tired of creating a complicated test rig to test your Motors, Servo’s or electric speed controller (ESC), then just use this to test your motor system without using a transmitter and receiver!

Rule out all the potential issues with your Transmitter/Receiver and other bits by using this.

This servo tester has 3 modes:

    – Manual mode: turn the dial to manually move up / down the full range.
    – Neutral mode: – Not sure of this function, It says “Goes to neutral position”
    – Wiper mode: Automatically goes up and down the full range

It has 3 Outputs so you can test 3 servos and or ESC’s at the same time.

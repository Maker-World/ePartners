## Descriptions

Since MG995 is a servo motor providing precise rotation over 180º range its applications are many and in them a few are stated below

-   The servo is suited for designing robotic arm in which wear and tear of motor is high. Being metal geared, the servo has long life and can be installed on system like robotic arm were motor work is huge.

-   The servo is also suited to be used in drones and toy planes. Having a satisfying torque which is enough to overcome air resistance and control wings of plane, the servo is preferred in toy planes and drones which need precision control no matter the condition.
